Unwrapping (HDBSCAN+RANSAC) and fitting (MCMC) the Gaia Phase Spiral and fitting in the polar space

1- Selection of the region by R and phi in gaalctocentric coordinates
2- Detection of the spiral with edge detector algorithm
3- Unwrapping the spiral with HDBSCAN and filtering inliers with RANSAC linear regressor
4- Fitting in the polar space with minimum squares and/or MCMC techniques (linear/quadratic/cubic)
